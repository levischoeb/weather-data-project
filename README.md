Web scraping Weather Data with Python

In this project we scraped weather data from st gallen to get a forecast of the next seven days. We ran the code on IDLE with Python version 3.9.0 on our Mac OS 11.0.1. Running the code with a different Python GUI or a different version Python / OS might cause errors. 

Introduction
To run the code you need to go through the following steps:
1. Open terminal on your mac to install requests, pandas and BeautifulSoup bs4. requests allows you to get the data from the web server. pandas is a      DataFrame which allows you to store tabular data to make data analysis easier. BeautifulSoup bs4 helps you to filter data based on HTML tags.

2. To install the packages first you need to install pip by entering: sudo easy_install pip

3. Afterwards you install the packages one after another on your terminal: 
   pip3 install requests 
   pip3 install pandas 
   pip3 install bs4
